### Notes
- it was planned as 3-month pet project but it lasted for 4 and even with +1 month deadline i couldn't do lots of things that i wanted. although of course i spent only a couple of hours a day on it, i think it's ok haha
- also i wanted to add some caching and queues but at this rate it'll drag on for another couple of weeks
- in the video logo on the top left disappeared from 0:36. it's cuz i took image source directly from instagram but it was blocked in russia lolll. before that i reseted browser cache behind the frame
